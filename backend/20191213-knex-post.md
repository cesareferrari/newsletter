In previous articles we have seen how to get both a collection of records and one single record as a response to a `GET` `API` request.
We used *Knex*, a popular query builder, to connect to a SQLite database and retrieve the records sent back by route handlers in our `API`.

Now we want to look at creating new records from an `API` request.
Creating new data involves using the `POST` `HTTP` verb, so we need a `router.post()` handler for the request:

```js
router.post('/', (req, res) => {

  // handle the route here

});
```

To create a new record we need its data, which is passed to our `API` in the request body. We need to first extract data from the body:

```js
const postData = req.body;
```

Once we have the `postData`, we use the `insert()` method of Knex to pass data to the database.
`insert()` will do the same thing as the `INSERT` statement in plain `SQL`, and add a new record.

This method will return an array that contains the `IDs` of the new records created.
Since we are creating one new record, our array will contain one element, but if we created *multiple* records instead, by passing an array of objects to `insert()`, we would get back all the `IDs` of the records created.

We can save this returned array in a variable and display it back to the client.
Here's the code for the post route handler:

```js
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  const postData = req.body;

  try {
    const ids = await db('posts').insert(postData);
    res.status(201).json(ids);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({message: "Error creating new post", error: err})
  }

});
```

Note that we are using `async/await` syntax because we are using promises.

If we now make a test post, the new record gets inserted correctly into the database.
We can test that the feature works as expected by making a `POST` request with Insomnia and passing a new record object in the body:

![POST record](https://ferrariwebdevelopment.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assets/20191213-knex-post2.png)

As you can see in the screenshot, we get a `201` status code, meaning new record created, and we get back an array with the `ID` or the new record.
